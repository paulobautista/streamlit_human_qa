Before 2005, our family spent their summer days eating the same frozen treats as every other American family. We enjoyed shaved ice with fruit juices, single and double popsicles, and peanut butter cups among other old-time favorites.

Then came the summer of 2005. The heat was relentless, and all the time-honored refreshment treats couldn't spare us from the triple-digit temperatures. It was then that we decided to dive into the world of ice cream and give our own brand a shot. We started out by mixing fresh milk with creamy melted chocolates and added crushed nuts to make our very first milkshakes. From there, things quickly took off.

Today, the Sprinkles lineup of more than 300 ice cream products is still produced by our family. Little has changed since the beginning, although we now operate our very own beautiful, state-of-the-art factory in Hackensack, New Jersey. Oh, and we've also added a few members to our family since.",http://www.ilikesprinkles.com,http://www.ilikesprinkles.com,https://instagram.com/sprinklesicecreamus,

It defines a community. It tells their story. Local. Global.

Everywhere in-between.

So at The Great Lakes Coffee Roasting Company, we've made it our business to help tell that story. The whole story. And that, in turn, is how we tell ours. Like many great American brands, we began in a garage with not much more than a leap of faith ‚Äî and our Italian father. His passion for the art and science that transformed those little green beans into the nuanced roasts we still offer is what inspires everything we do, every day, at our ever innovating roasting facility. But our story doesn't end there. After all, if you're traveling the globe to source only the finest and most responsibly grown coffee, it's no longer just your story. It's that farmer's story. And his family's story. It's a story about our relationship and responsibility to their passion for caffeinated excellence. It's also a story about how those people on the other side of the planet are helping to change the story in Detroit.

Here, with each grind and every pour, in the conversations we have and the discussions we lead, we're refining the grit of a great city into the ideas that are redefining what it means to be an even greater community. So whether you're sipping from your favorite mug at home or savoring that last drop at one of our bars, know you're part of our story. Because at The Great Lakes Coffee Roasting Company, it's not just about what you're drinking: It's about the journey to your cup‚Ä¶ And where we'll go from there.",http://www.greatlakescoffee.com,http://www.greatlakescoffee.com,https://instagram.com/greatlakescoffee,

In 1988, Kagome Japan established Kagome Inc. (Kagome) in Los Banos, California. The state-of-the-art production facility was completed in 1990, and we began shipping sauces to restaurant chains across the nation. Today, Kagome is known as one of the premier customized sauce developers and manufacturers for foodservice, servicing customers domestically and as far away as Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, and Australia.

To meet growing demand, Kagome has increased capacity at the Los Banos facility and in 2007 acquired Kagome Foods. This acquisition has optimized distribution in the eastern portion of the U.S, and provided new product and packaging types to our Kagome portfolio.

As international foodservice markets emerge, Kagome has followed strategies to best service those markets. Inner Mongolia Kagome Foods Inc., was established in 2005, in the most desirable tomato growing region in China. Then shortly thereafter, in the European Union, Kagome became a major shareholder in an organization formed by the merger of two major Portuguese tomato processing companies, Italagro and F.I.T.

Since we're all just very literally bodies of water, being dehydrated by 4% of your body mass can reduce your response time by nearly 25%. So whether you're at a building site or in the boardroom, staying hydrated makes you feel better and perform better too.

To help you do just that, we're proud to operate the only network of low waste vending stations serving a selection of purified water, carbonated, flavored, and branded drinks in infinite bottles that could never end up in landfill.

We've created bottled water for the future, making it ...

Safer: To lower the carbon output, we source water locally instead of shipping it, and purify it with an advanced filtration process. Our water quality beats market standards‚Äîand we like to keep things transparent by sharing that data with you.

Healthier: Along with clean water, we then create flavored and carbonated drinks free from microplastics, because our infinite bottles are made from glass or stainless steel.

You can also optimize your hydration with the Kadeya app, to make
sure you're always at your best.

By rethinking the bottled water supply chain entirely, we've created a circular system that makes a positive impact for both you and the planet with every sip, gulp and swig.",http://www.kadeya.com,http://www.kadeya.com,https://instagram.com/kadeya.club,

What began as a specialty goods importing and merchandising company in New York City has grown to become one of the world's largest producers of herbs and spices.

 At Kalustyan, our high-quality standards, services, and values keep us on top.

Kalustyan's Quality Center of Excellence is located in Union, NJ, and serves as the center of Kalustyan's resources and services.

 Using cryomilling, Kalustyan has revolutionized the way our spices look, taste, and feel. The cryomilling process grinds our products at subzero temperatures, retaining a high level of volatile oils and moisture, while standard milling would reduce these elements significantly.

Kalustyan offers a number of sterilization methods and we allow our customers to decide which method they prefer. 

Our sterilization methods include EtO, PPO, steam, and irradiation. As part of our commitment to food safety and sterilization, Kalustyan regularly keeps up with upcoming technology developments.

At Kalustyan, quality is our culture, which is why food safety is our top priority. By using our quality assurance laboratory, we ensure the prevention and reduction of microbiological and pathogen threats.

Our company takes an active role in complying with government regulations around the world and is the first to act if those regulations are changed. 

Our employees are regularly educated and updated with industry news and information in order to prevent hazards and other safety concerns with our products.",http://www.kalustyan.com,http://www.kalustyan.com,https://instagram.com/kalustyans,

These programs include the Open For Good Campaign, Chef's Bootcamp for Policy and Change, Beard House Fellows, Legacy Network, Scholarship Program, Smart Catch, and Women's Leadership Programs. In addition to maintaining the historic James Beard House in New York City's Greenwich Village as a ""performance space"" for visiting chefs, the Foundation has created a robust online community, and hosts conferences, tastings, lectures, workshops, and food-related art exhibits in New York City and around the country.

Everyone has someone in their life that is affected by allergies. Whether it means staying indoors when other kids go out to play, warily checking every plate and bowl served at a restaurant, or keeping an Epi-pen close at hand. Allergies are a constant concern for millions of people.
Jubli set out to demonstrate that it is possible to create a safe, major food allergen-free spread to be an alternative to peanut butter without compromising, texture, taste, nutritional, and family values.
In 2017 we hired two award-winning food engineers and challenged them to break conservative paradigms and create the first mind-blowingly delicious, 100% major food allergen-free spreads and snacks. And if that wasn't hard enough, it needs to have: perfect mouthfeel, amazing overall organoleptic experience, equal in nutritional values to nut butter, all-natural ingredients, non-GMO, no hydrogenated oils, no artificial sweeteners or added salt, be shelf-stable, no refrigeration needed, made in the U.S.A, sustainable, gluten-free, vegetarian, Kosher and oh, make it fair trade and eco-friendly.

From our origins making a handful of kegs and selling them out of the back of a van, to San Francisco's second largest craft brewery, we're still focused on making the highest quality West Coast-style craft beer that we can ‚Äì and barely keeping up with demand. 

Ten years ago our flagship, Big Daddy IPA, a bold, crisp India Pale Ale, came out to a huge applause, and has since risen to become San Francisco's #1 draft IPA brand. 

We're focused on continuing to innovate and make great beer better, putting out unique limited release and specialty beers in addition to our year-round offerings.

c0d32c93-bf98-444e-9b4e-6e4460fdae51,Senate of PA,"We started Honey, the Moon! Farms in an effort to support the ancient, natural beekeeping practices still being done in Greece and to share these unique, rare varietals with America.  We are out to change the way people think about honey. Honey, the Moon! Farms was started by 2 local PA beekeepers who love local honey. But when we met a beekeeper in Greece (also a friend) and tasted some of his honey, our minds were blown...He harvests some of the purest, most delicious, monofloral, raw honey we've ever tasted. Most importantly, he practices natural beekeeping, does not feed his bees extra sugar to make them produce higher quantities or use antibiotics and locates his hives far from agriculture in the mountains of the Thessaly Valley. Although Greece has some of the most unique varietal honeys, they export very little and it's hard to find this amazing product in the USA. In fact, 76% of the honey in US grocery stores couldn't even be labeled as honey in Europe. Humans consume 460 million tons of honey per year, but beekeepers harvest only 260 million tons. That doesn't add up. Adding corn and rice syrup to honey isn't just unhealthy for humans, it's also bad for global economic well-being.  It keeps the price of honey artificially low and prevents real beekeepers from earning a living.

What has changed is our product base: We began as a dairy and bakery ingredients supplier, and over the past 70 years, we've expanded into a full range of food and beverage manufacturing distribution. Today, our company represents over 100 ingredient manufacturers and 800 food ingredient items ‚Äî from private label spices to beverage ingredients to functional foods to organics and more ‚Äî and the technical knowledge of our sales force is unmatched in the food distribution industry. As a result, we're able to provide an excellent range of choice for our customers, along with critical production and formulation recommendations. The experience gained throughout these years lets us offer more to our clients ‚Äî it also comes with a great responsibility for safety and satisfaction, which we take very seriously.
 
Our current mission is exactly the same as it was when our founders began the business: We aim to provide our food manufacturing customers with premium, functional food ingredients, and the knowledge to make the most of them. We find great satisfaction in being the product behind the products, and in being a partner with each of our clients. We are confident that no one understands more about how to help you create food products that are nutritionally sound, efficiently produced and delicious.

The John R. White Company is proud of the vast body of expertise we've built throughout our history, but we understand that our credibility is dependent on the customer service and products that we currently provide. Every day, our goal is to be a little better than the day before and remain a valued partner to each and every one of our customers.",http://www.johnrwhite.com,,,

Each company is a family company of fishermen. Three generations of families working together. Many of us started out as deckhands and worked our way up. That work ethic, independent spirit and ""git-er'done"" attitude still informs our business, our culture and our way of life. And while we've grown up over the years and brought on board some folks who have cut their teeth out on the ""corporate sea,"" we still share that belief that a handshake still means something and that an honest day's work is worth more than a hatful of promises.


Ocean Gold is the largest shorebased processor of Pacific whiting on the West Coast, and we take special pride in our emerging tuna and sardine markets.


Ocean Protein allows for full-utilization of our resources, using every part of the fish instead of discarding the waste or trucking it out of the country.


Ocean Cold allows us to remove some of the seasonality out of our business and provide more steady employment opportunities for our community.

Anmao and Ben had been in Shanghai for over 5 years working on the city's first organic restaurant and grocery chain. Meanwhile Brandon was carving out his path with Mister Jiu's and the cuisine he was continuing to master as a homage to his grandmother and Chinese-American background. When they all came together, things clicked.

All three believe that the choices we make about the things we eat, where ingredients come from and how dishes are prepared have a direct and deeply-felt impact on the health of individuals and our communities. 

This is why Mamahuhu is devoted to cooking Chinese-American dishes from scratch with organically grown local produce and transparently raised animals.",http://www.eatmamahuhu.com,http://www.eatmamahuhu.com,https://instagram.com/eatmamahuhu,https://eatmamahuhu.com/blogs/mamahuhu-blog/tagged/recipes

9e9415e3-4186-4565-88e0-c49bd912bea4,Johnson's BBQ Shack,"A decade ago two brothers began smoking whole turkeys for Thanksgiving dinner. We prepared the first dinner using a Coleman electric smoker with nearly no knowledge of smoking meats. Starting the turkey around midnight, and allowing it to cook throughout the night, we used this as an excuse to have a few beers. Fortunately, the smoked turkey was a hit and so began the years and tradition of smoked turkey for Thanksgiving and other holidays. Quickly, we gained experience smoking other meats for summer outings, parties, and other small events. 

Over the years we have experimented with many variations of dry rubs and eventually, developed a dry rub we now use on most of our meats. We use local shagbark hickory wood. With our experiences gained in fourteen years of slow and low heat smoking meats, developing our rub, and honing our skills we are proud to be cooking in a custom built Nolen's Rotisserie Smoker and look forward to have the opportunity to bring our product to our customers or serve you in our 3 restaurants located in Bargersville, IN and Greenwood, IN.",http://www.johnsonsbbqshack.com,,,

As the innovative leader in the specialty beverage category, Dr. Smoothie Brands broke new ground in 1997 with the introduction of the shelf stable fruit smoothie concentrate with no artificial ingredients.

In 2001, maintaining the company mantra that ""everything we do has a healthy twist"" Cafe Essentials introduced a frappe line with 15% to 25% less sugar and up to 50% less fat than the competition.

In 2003 we introduced 100% Crushed, a 100% fruit smoothie meeting the ""Five a Day"" daily fruit recommendation per 20 oz.

Innovation continued in 2009 when the entire Cafe Essentials frappe and hot beverage Program featured NO artificial flavors, NO artificial sweeteners & NO artificial colors, While continuing with less fat and sugar.

As the public searches for ""cleaner labels"" and more pure products, Dr. Smoothie Brands responds in 2012 with the CRUSHED Experiential ready-to-drink. Featuring natural fruit nutrition instead of synthetic vitamins. This clean label, authentic platform brings exciting tastes, textures, and aromas from around the world.

Excess calorie content is on everyone's mind, so Dr. Smoothie Brands developed FIT-LYTE, a 35% to 55% reduced calorie smoothie with stevia, white tea, and coconut water.

And more is on the way, we promise‚Ä¶

While M√¨L√† is a Chinese food brand, it's really a celebration of the power of food to bring us together, share our stories, and discover new flavors and cultures. Our team works tirelessly to enhance delicious products that we all enjoy at home! 

History

You may remember us as Xiao Chi Jie, or XCJ. We opened in 2018 as Xiao Chi Jie, a restaurant in Bellevue, WA, where we shared the amazing ingredients, recipes, and flavors of our Chinese heritage. Since then, we've grown, and so has our passion for what we do. 

In 2023, XCJ became M√¨L√†. As we evolved, we wanted a new name that felt authentically Chinese but could keep growing with us. M√¨L√† means honey (mi Ëúú) and spice (la Ëæ£) in Chinese. We're the same small team, making the same insanely delicious products, just with a new look. 

Mission

M√¨L√†'s mission is to build something that feels authentically and uniquely true to our roots as a Chinese American-founded brand. Something we can own, but that's also meant to be shared. One of the things we love about Chinese food is that it's traditionally served family-style‚Äîshared with everyone gathered at the table. M√¨L√† is a Chinese food brand, but it's really a celebration of the power of food to bring us together, share our stories, and discover new flavors and cultures.

We first discovered poke while chasing sunsets in Maui. The store was a small shack, but the poke left a big impression. When we made the decision to open our first location, we had one theme in mind: Give More. It's a simple idea, but one we take to heart. So we set out to run our business the right way. From our vendors and partners, to our employees and customers, we decided to put people first. We turned away big national players with lower prices, preferring instead to partner with local vendors. In constructing our stores, we used recycled materials, energy efficient lighting and low VOC paint. We decided against cheap plastic inventory that was bad for the environment and pursued materials that were biodegradable and compostable. For us, Washington isn't just a state to do business in, it's a home to take care of. Our belief is a simple one.

Eat Clean, Act Right, and Live Well.

In 1860, the iconic square bottle hit the shelves thanks to John's son Alexander. And in 1877, the slanted label was added, making Walker's Old Highland whisky highly recognisable the world over. The Walker brothers renamed their whiskies in deference to their customers' habit of identifying them by their coloured labels in 1909. And today, you can choose from five unique blends to suit any moment, and no matter which you choose, you can be assured of the consistency and quality of flavour that's kept us walking for almost 200 years.",http://www.johnniewalker.com,http://www.johnniewalker.com,https://instagram.com/johnniewalker,https://www.johnniewalker.com/en-us/whisky-cocktails/cocktails

As he rolled corporate dough and spread store-bought sauce, he realized he could make a better product and break the monopoly Big Pizza held on the campus market.

Thus was born, with the help of Jeff's partner Lennie Busch, the first Pizza Express. Its from-scratch, by-hand pizza won an instant following, a rare feat for a small business in the quick-serve dining world. Now with five locations (under the new, trademarkable name Pizza X), it remains Bloomington's favorite pizza delivery service nearly 30 years later.

Since the  opening of Pizza X (formerly known as Pizza Express), OWE has opened a different restaurant called ""Lennie's""‚Äã, as well as OWE KitchenShare and OWE Catering and Events.

The future of OWE will include continued movement toward greater sustainability and community-sourced ingredients. What it won't hold is any sort of expansion that looks beyond the Bloomington area. We have no desire to get bigger, only to become a more integral, responsible, and valued part of the Bloomington community.",http://www.bloomington.com,,,

716dcaf1-5c09-4293-953d-044fb30e660f,Worthington,"Worthington Foods, Inc., has grown from a tiny manufacturer of specialty foods into a leader of the U.S. markets for vegetarian foods and meat alternatives. The business traces its heritage to 1939, when Dr. George T. Harding III founded Special Foods in Worthington, Ohio. Harding established Special Foods to supply vegetarian foods to his father's nearby sanitarium (health spa). With companies like Michigan's Battle Creek Foods Company, Tennessee's Madison Foods, and California's Loma Linda Foods as models, Harding, his wife Mary Virginia, and four other investors bought and refurbished a fire-damaged house and started production in 1939.

Special Foods' early products were fashioned after ""nut meats,"" first concocted by Dr. John Kellogg, the first Adventist to become a medical doctor. They combined roasted peanuts with gluten (derived from flour) and seasonings to form meatless, yet high-protein main courses like PROAST, a substitute for dark meat, and NUMETE, a substitute for light meat.

Worthington Foods was aquired by Heritage Health Food in 2016, and continues to innovate and grow in the vegetarian food industry. 

Worthington is committed to producing high quality, vegetarian products to promote healthful living. Aspiring to be the ""World's Best!"", Worthington seeks to expand the options for those pursuing a meatless, plant based lifestyle and satisfy the tastebuds of all who partake.",http://www.eatworthington.com,http://www.eatworthington.com,https://instagram.com/worthingtonfoods,https://serveworthington.com/recipe-search/

We provide a range of commodity shell eggs, specialty eggs, and egg products. Our top priority is to produce the highest quality products with the utmost regard for food safety.

As far back as the 1930s, the Rust family began egg production with the largest hen house in Jackson County during that period. The population surge of the 1940s and 1950s initiated a need for farm commodities in major metropolitan areas. Beginning in the 1950s, construction had begun on the first modern chicken houses in Seymour, Indiana. Egg sales were made throughout the local area and regular trips were made to the Indianapolis Farmers Market from the main farms in southern Indiana. As consumer needs changed during the 1980s and 1990s, so did the variety of egg products offered by Rose Acre Farms. As we moved toward the close of the century, Rose Acre Farms had established plants in Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, Georgia and North Carolina. In addition, two plants in Illinois followed shortly into the twenty first century. From a small handful of employees in the 1950s to over 1820 today, Rose Acre Farms continues to remain on the cutting edge of this ever-changing industry. Remaining the largest family-owned egg producer in the United States, continued innovation and market demand promise a bright future for our employees and customers.",http://www.goodegg.com,http://www.goodegg.com,https://instagram.com/roseacrefarms,https://www.goodegg.com/recipes

For founder Rob Webb, coffee was the means to create change ‚Äî inspired by a personal journey that began with love and grew into a movement to support communities worldwide.

In 2009, while preparing to adopt two children from Ethiopia, Rob reflected on the costs, sacrifices, and challenges that come with adoption. That's when an idea sparked: what if he could start a coffee roasting business that gave back to families, communities, and causes in need? With that vision, Just Love Coffee Roasters was born in a modest 800-square-foot space, with a small roaster, a handful of coffee profiles, and a simple online store. Rob's mission wasn't just to sell coffee but to create a social partnership with customers who share a love of community and compassion.

Today, Just Love Coffee Roasters supplies hand-roasted, ethically sourced coffee to individual customers, churches, offices, retailers, restaurants, and especially Just Love Coffee & Cafe locations nationwide. Each cafe proudly serves our coffees, creating spaces for people to gather, connect, and enjoy ‚Äî all while supporting a business that puts people before profit.

Our Cause Coffees go beyond great taste, contributing directly to community initiatives, educational programs, and local charities. Our franchisees support regional causes, and we look for opportunities to partner with organizations making a difference in the world.

18d27dde-5bd2-4c6b-ae19-b98643b9cd05,Johnny's Pizza House,"From a tiny store with three parking spaces in 1967 to the largest locally owned pizza chain in North Louisiana, Johnny's Pizza has come a long way, tossing and turning the region's favorite pizza without fail day after day. 

Johnny Huntsman had always wanted to go into business for himself. But the only thing he knew at the time was how to make one heck of a pizza--learned while working at a pizza place in college. 

One day he passed by (what is now) the University of Louisiana at Monroe and saw a building for rent. And with some borrowed money he opened his first restaurant on DeSiard Street. There were no other pizza stores in Monroe in those days. And most people around had never eaten pizza. 

Things started off slow, and when a national chain came to town and started advertising in a big way, Huntsman thought it was over. Instead, the advertising created awareness about pizza, and Huntsman's product started to take hold and claim its own following. 

After fast growth in the 70s and 80s and a trickle-down effect from Louisiana's economy, times got tough. However, that's when Huntsman persevered and used brilliant grassroots marketing tactics, which included standing by the busiest intersection in Monroe, donned in a barrel, suspenders, sneakers and a ball cap with a sign that read ""Please Eat Johnny's Pizza.""‚Äã 

As a result, in came the media and publicity. Huntsman did the same thing in Shreveport, and sales bounced back, rededicating the company's efforts to North Louisiana. Long known for great products (Johnny's consistently ranks as North Louisiana's favorite pizza) as well as outstanding community service, Johnny's Pizza House commands a large market share percentage.

So many great years of terrific pizza. So many great years of community service. So many great years of believing in people. Thanks for the good times, Johnny!",http://www.johnnysph.com,,,
