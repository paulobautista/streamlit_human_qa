Before 2005, our family spent their summer days eating the same frozen treats as every other American family. We enjoyed shaved ice with fruit juices, single and double popsicles, and peanut butter cups among other old-time favorites.

Then came the summer of 2005. The heat was relentless, and all the time-honored refreshment treats couldn't spare us from the triple-digit temperatures. It was then that we decided to dive into the world of ice cream and give our own brand a shot. We started out by mixing fresh milk with creamy melted chocolates and added crushed nuts to make our very first milkshakes. From there, things quickly took off.

Today, the Sprinkles lineup of more than 300 ice cream products is still produced by our family. Little has changed since the beginning, although we now operate our very own beautiful, state-of-the-art factory in Hackensack, New Jersey. Oh, and we've also added a few members to our family since.",http://www.ilikesprinkles.com,http://www.ilikesprinkles.com,https://instagram.com/sprinklesicecreamus,

It defines a community. It tells their story. Local. Global.

Everywhere in-between.

So at The Great Lakes Coffee Roasting Company, we've made it our business to help tell that story. The whole story. And that, in turn, is how we tell ours. Like many great American brands, we began in a garage with not much more than a leap of faith ‚Äî and our Italian father. His passion for the art and science that transformed those little green beans into the nuanced roasts we still offer is what inspires everything we do, every day, at our ever innovating roasting facility. But our story doesn't end there. After all, if you're traveling the globe to source only the finest and most responsibly grown coffee, it's no longer just your story. It's that farmer's story. And his family's story. It's a story about our relationship and responsibility to their passion for caffeinated excellence. It's also a story about how those people on the other side of the planet are helping to change the story in Detroit.

Here, with each grind and every pour, in the conversations we have and the discussions we lead, we're refining the grit of a great city into the ideas that are redefining what it means to be an even greater community. So whether you're sipping from your favorite mug at home or savoring that last drop at one of our bars, know you're part of our story. Because at The Great Lakes Coffee Roasting Company, it's not just about what you're drinking: It's about the journey to your cup‚Ä¶ And where we'll go from there.",http://www.greatlakescoffee.com,http://www.greatlakescoffee.com,https://instagram.com/greatlakescoffee,

In 1988, Kagome Japan established Kagome Inc. (Kagome) in Los Banos, California. The state-of-the-art production facility was completed in 1990, and we began shipping sauces to restaurant chains across the nation. Today, Kagome is known as one of the premier customized sauce developers and manufacturers for foodservice, servicing customers domestically and as far away as Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, and Australia.

To meet growing demand, Kagome has increased capacity at the Los Banos facility and in 2007 acquired Kagome Foods. This acquisition has optimized distribution in the eastern portion of the U.S, and provided new product and packaging types to our Kagome portfolio.

As international foodservice markets emerge, Kagome has followed strategies to best service those markets. Inner Mongolia Kagome Foods Inc., was established in 2005, in the most desirable tomato growing region in China. Then shortly thereafter, in the European Union, Kagome became a major shareholder in an organization formed by the merger of two major Portuguese tomato processing companies, Italagro and F.I.T. With Kagome Japan's extensive resources across the globe in ingredient sourcing and manufacturing technologies we have successfully extended our international business initiatives, bringing the good taste of Kagome to every corner of the world.",http://www.kagomeusa.com,http://www.kagomeusa.com,https://instagram.com/kagomeusa,https://kagomeusa.com/

Since we're all just very literally bodies of water, being dehydrated by 4% of your body mass can reduce your response time by nearly 25%. So whether you're at a building site or in the boardroom, staying hydrated makes you feel better and perform better too.

To help you do just that, we're proud to operate the only network of low waste vending stations serving a selection of purified water, carbonated, flavored, and branded drinks in infinite bottles that could never end up in landfill.

We've created bottled water for the future, making it ...

Safer: To lower the carbon output, we source water locally instead of shipping it, and purify it with an advanced filtration process. Our water quality beats market standards‚Äîand we like to keep things transparent by sharing that data with you.

Healthier: Along with clean water, we then create flavored and carbonated drinks free from microplastics, because our infinite bottles are made from glass or stainless steel.

You can also optimize your hydration with the Kadeya app, to make
sure you're always at your best.

By rethinking the bottled water supply chain entirely, we've created a circular system that makes a positive impact for both you and the planet with every sip, gulp and swig.",http://www.kadeya.com,http://www.kadeya.com,https://instagram.com/kadeya.club,

What began as a specialty goods importing and merchandising company in New York City has grown to become one of the world's largest producers of herbs and spices.

Kalustyan's Quality Center of Excellence is located in Union, NJ, and serves as the center of Kalustyan's resources and services.

 Using cryomilling, Kalustyan has revolutionized the way our spices look, taste, and feel. The cryomilling process grinds our products at subzero temperatures, retaining a high level of volatile oils and moisture, while standard milling would reduce these elements significantly.

Kalustyan offers a number of sterilization methods and we allow our customers to decide which method they prefer.

Our sterilization methods include EtO, PPO, steam, and irradiation. As part of our commitment to food safety and sterilization, Kalustyan regularly keeps up with upcoming technology developments.

Food is economics, politics, entertainment, culture, fashion, family, passion...and nourishment. The James Beard Foundation is at the center of America's culinary community, dedicated to exploring the way food enriches our lives.

A cookbook author and teacher, James Beard was a champion of American cuisine who helped educate and mentor generations of professional chefs and food enthusiasts. Today the Beard Foundation continues in the same spirit by offering a variety of events and programs designed to educate, inspire, entertain, and foster a deeper understanding of our culinary culture. These programs include the Open For Good Campaign, Chef's Bootcamp for Policy and Change, Beard House Fellows, Legacy Network, Scholarship Program, Smart Catch, and Women's Leadership Programs. In addition to maintaining the historic James Beard House in New York City's Greenwich Village as a ""performance space"" for visiting chefs, the Foundation has created a robust online community, and hosts conferences, tastings, lectures, workshops, and food-related art exhibits in New York City and around the country.

Everyone has someone in their life that is affected by allergies. Whether it means staying indoors when other kids go out to play, warily checking every plate and bowl served at a restaurant, or keeping an Epi-pen close at hand. Allergies are a constant concern for millions of people.
Jubli set out to demonstrate that it is possible to create a safe, major food allergen-free spread to be an alternative to peanut butter without compromising, texture, taste, nutritional, and family values.
In 2017 we hired two award-winning food engineers and challenged them to break conservative paradigms and create the first mind-blowingly delicious, 100% major food allergen-free spreads and snacks. And if that wasn't hard enough, it needs to have: perfect mouthfeel, amazing overall organoleptic experience, equal in nutritional values to nut butter, all-natural ingredients, non-GMO, no hydrogenated oils, no artificial sweeteners or added salt, be shelf-stable, no refrigeration needed, made in the U.S.A, sustainable, gluten-free, vegetarian, Kosher and oh, make it fair trade and eco-friendly.

Born from that passion came our first beer, Prohibition Ale, a classic American Amber Ale richly hopped and well-balanced that was a hit when the first keg rolled off the line. From our origins making a handful of kegs and selling them out of the back of a van, to San Francisco's second largest craft brewery, we're still focused on making the highest quality West Coast-style craft beer that we can ‚Äì and barely keeping up with demand.

Ten years ago our flagship, Big Daddy IPA, a bold, crisp India Pale Ale, came out to a huge applause, and has since risen to become San Francisco's #1 draft IPA brand.

We're focused on continuing to innovate and make great beer better, putting out unique limited release and specialty beers in addition to our year-round offerings.

c0d32c93-bf98-444e-9b4e-6e4460fdae51,Senate of PA,"We started Honey, the Moon! Farms in an effort to support the ancient, natural beekeeping practices still being done in Greece and to share these unique, rare varietals with America.  We are out to change the way people think about honey. Honey, the Moon! Farms was started by 2 local PA beekeepers who love local honey. But when we met a beekeeper in Greece (also a friend) and tasted some of his honey, our minds were blown...He harvests some of the purest, most delicious, monofloral, raw honey we've ever tasted. Most importantly, he practices natural beekeeping, does not feed his bees extra sugar to make them produce higher quantities or use antibiotics and locates his hives far from agriculture in the mountains of the Thessaly Valley. Although Greece has some of the most unique varietal honeys, they export very little and it's hard to find this amazing product in the USA. In fact, 76% of the honey in US grocery stores couldn't even be labeled as honey in Europe. Humans consume 460 million tons of honey per year, but beekeepers harvest only 260 million tons. That doesn't add up. Adding corn and rice syrup to honey isn't just unhealthy for humans, it's also bad for global economic well-being.  It keeps the price of honey artificially low and prevents real beekeepers from earning a living. H,TM!F wants to do their part to change that inequity.",http://www.honeythemoon.com,http://www.honeythemoon.com,https://instagram.com/honeythemoonfarms,

Each company is a family company of fishermen. Three generations of families working together. Many of us started out as deckhands and worked our way up. That work ethic, independent spirit and ""git-er'done"" attitude still informs our business, our culture and our way of life. And while we've grown up over the years and brought on board some folks who have cut their teeth out on the ""corporate sea,"" we still share that belief that a handshake still means something and that an honest day's work is worth more than a hatful of promises.


Ocean Gold is the largest shorebased processor of Pacific whiting on the West Coast, and we take special pride in our emerging tuna and sardine markets.


Ocean Protein allows for full-utilization of our resources, using every part of the fish instead of discarding the waste or trucking it out of the country.


Ocean Cold allows us to remove some of the seasonality out of our business and provide more steady employment opportunities for our community.


Ocean Express, our emerging trucking division, further aligns the vertical integration of our operation so that we can control our quality from start to finish.",http://www.keepgraysharborfishing.com,http://www.keepgraysharborfishing.com,,

Anmao and Ben had been in Shanghai for over 5 years working on the city's first organic restaurant and grocery chain. Meanwhile Brandon was carving out his path with Mister Jiu's and the cuisine he was continuing to master as a homage to his grandmother and Chinese-American background. When they all came together, things clicked.

All three believe that the choices we make about the things we eat, where ingredients come from and how dishes are prepared have a direct and deeply-felt impact on the health of individuals and our communities.

This is why Mamahuhu is devoted to cooking Chinese-American dishes from scratch with organically grown local produce and transparently raised animals.",http://www.eatmamahuhu.com,http://www.eatmamahuhu.com,https://instagram.com/eatmamahuhu,https://eatmamahuhu.com/blogs/mamahuhu-blog/tagged/recipes

Starting the turkey around midnight, and allowing it to cook throughout the night, we used this as an excuse to have a few beers. Fortunately, the smoked turkey was a hit and so began the years and tradition of smoked turkey for Thanksgiving and other holidays. Quickly, we gained experience smoking other meats for summer outings, parties, and other small events.

Over the years we have experimented with many variations of dry rubs and eventually, developed a dry rub we now use on most of our meats. We use local shagbark hickory wood. With our experiences gained in fourteen years of slow and low heat smoking meats, developing our rub, and honing our skills we are proud to be cooking in a custom built Nolen's Rotisserie Smoker and look forward to have the opportunity to bring our product to our customers or serve you in our 3 restaurants located in Bargersville, IN and Greenwood, IN.",http://www.johnsonsbbqshack.com,,,

As the innovative leader in the specialty beverage category, Dr. Smoothie Brands broke new ground in 1997 with the introduction of the shelf stable fruit smoothie concentrate with no artificial ingredients.

In 2001, maintaining the company mantra that ""everything we do has a healthy twist"" Cafe Essentials introduced a frappe line with 15% to 25% less sugar and up to 50% less fat than the competition.

In 2003 we introduced 100% Crushed, a 100% fruit smoothie meeting the ""Five a Day"" daily fruit recommendation per 20 oz.

Innovation continued in 2009 when the entire Cafe Essentials frappe and hot beverage Program featured NO artificial flavors, NO artificial sweeteners & NO artificial colors, While continuing with less fat and sugar.

As the public searches for ""cleaner labels"" and more pure products, Dr. Smoothie Brands responds in 2012 with the CRUSHED Experiential ready-to-drink. Featuring natural fruit nutrition instead of synthetic vitamins. This clean label, authentic platform brings exciting tastes, textures, and aromas from around the world.

Excess calorie content is on everyone's mind, so Dr. Smoothie Brands developed FIT-LYTE, a 35% to 55% reduced calorie smoothie with stevia, white tea, and coconut water.

And more is on the way, we promise‚Ä¶

While M√¨L√† is a Chinese food brand, it's really a celebration of the power of food to bring us together, share our stories, and discover new flavors and cultures. Our team works tirelessly to enhance delicious products that we all enjoy at home!

History

You may remember us as Xiao Chi Jie, or XCJ. We opened in 2018 as Xiao Chi Jie, a restaurant in Bellevue, WA, where we shared the amazing ingredients, recipes, and flavors of our Chinese heritage. Since then, we've grown, and so has our passion for what we do.

In 2023, XCJ became M√¨L√†. As we evolved, we wanted a new name that felt authentically Chinese but could keep growing with us. M√¨L√† means honey (mi Ëúú) and spice (la Ëæ£) in Chinese. We're the same small team, making the same insanely delicious products, just with a new look.

Mission

M√¨L√†'s mission is to build something that feels authentically and uniquely true to our roots as a Chinese American-founded brand. Something we can own, but that's also meant to be shared. One of the things we love about Chinese food is that it's traditionally served family-style‚Äîshared with everyone gathered at the table. M√¨L√† is a Chinese food brand, but it's really a celebration of the power of food to bring us together, share our stories, and discover new flavors and cultures.

We first discovered poke while chasing sunsets in Maui. The store was a small shack, but the poke left a big impression. When we made the decision to open our first location, we had one theme in mind: Give More. It's a simple idea, but one we take to heart. So we set out to run our business the right way. From our vendors and partners, to our employees and customers, we decided to put people first. We turned away big national players with lower prices, preferring instead to partner with local vendors. In constructing our stores, we used recycled materials, energy efficient lighting and low VOC paint. We decided against cheap plastic inventory that was bad for the environment and pursued materials that were biodegradable and compostable. For us, Washington isn't just a state to do business in, it's a home to take care of. Our belief is a simple one.

Eat Clean, Act Right, and Live Well.

As he rolled corporate dough and spread store-bought sauce, he realized he could make a better product and break the monopoly Big Pizza held on the campus market.

Thus was born, with the help of Jeff's partner Lennie Busch, the first Pizza Express. Its from-scratch, by-hand pizza won an instant following, a rare feat for a small business in the quick-serve dining world. Now with five locations (under the new, trademarkable name Pizza X), it remains Bloomington's favorite pizza delivery service nearly 30 years later.

Since the  opening of Pizza X (formerly known as Pizza Express), OWE has opened a different restaurant called ""Lennie's""‚Äã, as well as OWE KitchenShare and OWE Catering and Events.

716dcaf1-5c09-4293-953d-044fb30e660f,Worthington,"Worthington Foods, Inc., has grown from a tiny manufacturer of specialty foods into a leader of the U.S. markets for vegetarian foods and meat alternatives. The business traces its heritage to 1939, when Dr. George T. Harding III founded Special Foods in Worthington, Ohio. Harding established Special Foods to supply vegetarian foods to his father's nearby sanitarium (health spa). With companies like Michigan's Battle Creek Foods Company, Tennessee's Madison Foods, and California's Loma Linda Foods as models, Harding, his wife Mary Virginia, and four other investors bought and refurbished a fire-damaged house and started production in 1939.

Special Foods' early products were fashioned after ""nut meats,"" first concocted by Dr. John Kellogg, the first Adventist to become a medical doctor. They combined roasted peanuts with gluten (derived from flour) and seasonings to form meatless, yet high-protein main courses like PROAST, a substitute for dark meat, and NUMETE, a substitute for light meat.

Worthington Foods was aquired by Heritage Health Food in 2016, and continues to innovate and grow in the vegetarian food industry.

Worthington is committed to producing high quality, vegetarian products to promote healthful living. Aspiring to be the ""World's Best!"", Worthington seeks to expand the options for those pursuing a meatless, plant based lifestyle and satisfy the tastebuds of all who partake.",http://www.eatworthington.com,http://www.eatworthington.com,https://instagram.com/worthingtonfoods,https://serveworthington.com/recipe-search/

We provide a range of commodity shell eggs, specialty eggs, and egg products. Our top priority is to produce the highest quality products with the utmost regard for food safety.

As far back as the 1930s, the Rust family began egg production with the largest hen house in Jackson County during that period. The population surge of the 1940s and 1950s initiated a need for farm commodities in major metropolitan areas. Beginning in the 1950s, construction had begun on the first modern chicken houses in Seymour, Indiana. Egg sales were made throughout the local area and regular trips were made to the Indianapolis Farmers Market from the main farms in southern Indiana. As consumer needs changed during the 1980s and 1990s, so did the variety of egg products offered by Rose Acre Farms. As we moved toward the close of the century, Rose Acre Farms had established plants in Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, Georgia and North Carolina. In addition, two plants in Illinois followed shortly into the twenty first century. From a small handful of employees in the 1950s to over 1820 today, Rose Acre Farms continues to remain on the cutting edge of this ever-changing industry. Remaining the largest family-owned egg producer in the United States, continued innovation and market demand promise a bright future for our employees and customers.",http://www.goodegg.com,http://www.goodegg.com,https://instagram.com/roseacrefarms,https://www.goodegg.com/recipes

For founder Rob Webb, coffee was the means to create change ‚Äî inspired by a personal journey that began with love and grew into a movement to support communities worldwide.

In 2009, while preparing to adopt two children from Ethiopia, Rob reflected on the costs, sacrifices, and challenges that come with adoption. That's when an idea sparked: what if he could start a coffee roasting business that gave back to families, communities, and causes in need? With that vision, Just Love Coffee Roasters was born in a modest 800-square-foot space, with a small roaster, a handful of coffee profiles, and a simple online store. Rob's mission wasn't just to sell coffee but to create a social partnership with customers who share a love of community and compassion.

Today, Just Love Coffee Roasters supplies hand-roasted, ethically sourced coffee to individual customers, churches, offices, retailers, restaurants, and especially Just Love Coffee & Cafe locations nationwide. Each cafe proudly serves our coffees, creating spaces for people to gather, connect, and enjoy ‚Äî all while supporting a business that puts people before profit.

Coffee with a Cause
Our Cause Coffees go beyond great taste, contributing directly to community initiatives, educational programs, and local charities. Our franchisees support regional causes, and we look for opportunities to partner with organizations making a difference in the world. Every cup of coffee you enjoy from us ‚Äî whether from a cafe or your own kitchen ‚Äî is part of a larger mission to help others.

18d27dde-5bd2-4c6b-ae19-b98643b9cd05,Johnny's Pizza House,"From a tiny store with three parking spaces in 1967 to the largest locally owned pizza chain in North Louisiana, Johnny's Pizza has come a long way, tossing and turning the region's favorite pizza without fail day after day.

Johnny Huntsman had always wanted to go into business for himself. But the only thing he knew at the time was how to make one heck of a pizza--learned while working at a pizza place in college.

One day he passed by (what is now) the University of Louisiana at Monroe and saw a building for rent. And with some borrowed money he opened his first restaurant on DeSiard Street. There were no other pizza stores in Monroe in those days. And most people around had never eaten pizza.

Things started off slow, and when a national chain came to town and started advertising in a big way, Huntsman thought it was over. Instead, the advertising created awareness about pizza, and Huntsman's product started to take hold and claim its own following.

After fast growth in the 70s and 80s and a trickle-down effect from Louisiana's economy, times got tough. However, that's when Huntsman persevered and used brilliant grassroots marketing tactics, which included standing by the busiest intersection in Monroe, donned in a barrel, suspenders, sneakers and a ball cap with a sign that read ""Please Eat Johnny's Pizza.""‚Äã

As a result, in came the media and publicity. Huntsman did the same thing in Shreveport, and sales bounced back, rededicating the company's efforts to North Louisiana. Long known for great products (Johnny's consistently ranks as North Louisiana's favorite pizza) as well as outstanding community service, Johnny's Pizza House commands a large market share percentage.

So many great years of terrific pizza. So many great years of community service. So many great years of believing in people. Thanks for the good times, Johnny!",http://www.johnnysph.com,,,

History

Established in 2000.

Kimmie Candy Company was started by Joe Dutra on his family farm in Sacramento, California as part of an international agriculture seed business and stayed a family affair ever since.  Though manufacturing was moved offshore to Korea; as the business began to grow, the search was on for a USA manufacturing location.  In 2004, they decided it was time to bring Kimmie Candy back to the USA and create American jobs.  The Dutra family chose Reno, Nevada because of its business- friendly climate and nearness to California, their home state.  Kimmie Candy Company bought a building in 2006 and built out the factory in 2007. It had its first full year of production in 2008 and has been growing exponentially ever since.",http://www.kimmiecandy.com,http://www.kimmiecandy.com,https://instagram.com/kimmiecandy,

That's when we first opened the doors to Marczyk Fine Foods.  Pete Marczyk has always been passionate about great ingredients, but was frustrated at having to drive all over Denver to find them.  One place for fish, another for meat, another for produce‚Ä¶ you get the picture.  Pete raised the funds to start his market, hired the contractor, found the staff and filled the shelves with products Denver had never seen under one roof:  sustainably raised beef, pork and lamb from family farms, unique and interesting Italian imports, old fashioned sodas, milk in glass bottles, amazing Colorado-made products, and so much more.  We are a neighborhood market where people can get great ingredients for breakfast, lunch and dinner or really excellent prepared food for an easy meal.

We opened a second location in 2011 at the corner of Colfax and Fairfax, in a building that once was a Safeway store.  Same great ingredients, plus a great, big kitchen to create all our prepared foods. In 2012 we celebrated our first store's 10 year anniversary.  That same year Pete and Paul's long-time dream of starting an in-house bakery for fresh baguettes and sandwich breads came to fruition.  Our special events, like summer burger nights, our Colfax anniversary clambake, and the fall pig roast continue to build community, and the Colorado offerings just get better and better. Stay tuned, because there's always something great being cooked up at Marczyk's!",http://www.marczykfinefoods.com,,,

Some forty years later it has been this vision of service that has placed Mid South as a vending leader in the tri-state region. Today, Mid South employs seventy people. We presently run twenty five routes in Alabama, Tennessee, and Mississippi. It is our goal to maintain our solid relationships in the business community, as well as developing new ones.

Keswick Vineyards, established in 2000 by Al & Cindy Schornberg, is a family owned and operated Charlottesville winery specializing in small lots of high-quality wines that showcase the terroir of the Estate. Originally from Michigan, the Schornbergs chose Charlottesville, Virginia to pursue their dream of owning a vineyard after an extensive search that spanned coast to coast. Al recalls his grandfather's stories of working at his uncle's winery, Massena Cellars in France, and like his predecessor, his goal was straightforward: ""I just wanted to be able to enjoy a really good wine that I made. There's something very natural and satisfying about that."" With their first vintage in 2002 winning the honor of ""Best White Wine in America"" at the Atlanta International Wine Summit, the Schornbergs knew they had made the right decision and set out to prove Charlottesville wineries could also produce award-winning reds. In 2009 they were awarded the Virginia Governor's Cup for their 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon, further transforming their dream into a reality. Now, in 2016 Keswick Vineyards received their second Virginia Governor's Cup for their 2014 Cabernet Franc Reserve. The Schornbergs are humbled and excited that their vision has evolved into a world-class Virginia vineyard and winery, with each year's vintage better than the last.",http://www.keswickvineyards.com,http://www.keswickvineyards.com,https://instagram.com/keswickvineyards,

How do we know? We grew up here in Clarksville, Tennessee, and our give a damn runs pretty high.

For us, it's all about hand crafting spirits the right way. In the case of our whiskey, that means using grains grown by farmers we run into at the barbershop and never taking shortcuts. Which is why our most prized Tennessee Whiskey is a few years from release. The oak barrels only ask for time to work their magic, and as a self-respecting Tennessee Whiskey distiller, we're not about to mess with what works.

To help tide you over, we're crafting a limited quantity of our primo, wheat based SmoothShine Tennessee Moonshine; a spry spirit big on character with just the right amount of that ""Come get'cha some"".

If Whiskey doesn't strike your fancy, we'll be sure to convert you, but in the meantime we're developing a Premium Tennessee Vodka offering sure to please. This spirit is made from 100% Non-GMO corn that's ground, mashed, fermented, and distilled on site. To top it off, we filter it through the same sugar maple charcoal used for our Tennessee Whiskey. The result? Well, let's just say martinis and gimlets will never be the same.

Now these spirits are just the tip of the iceberg. We wouldn't be an ""Artisan"" distillery without expanding the horizons of spirits as we know them. Craft Breweries did for beer what Artisan Distilleries are doing for spirits. We guarantee you'll be excited for what we have in store.

Here's to all the good times to come! Cheers!",http://www.oldglorydistilling.com,,,

Founded in 1977 by brothers who came to America from the mountainous region of northern Lebanon, Neomonde has a spirit all its own. That's because the Saleh brothers Samir (""Sam""), Joseph (""Joe""), Mounir, and DeGaulle decided long ago that anything they sell must be good enough to serve their own family. They consider it their responsibility as ambassadors of their country and their culture to provide nothing less than the best.

Their dedication to excellence and authenticity began when the brothers were just boys, growing up in Lebanon. They tended the family's wheat fields, harvesting grain and taking it to be ground at the town mill. They watched their mother, Cecilia, mix dough and bake bread in the communal kiln. In the evening, when the family gathered together to eat, the texture and delicious taste of bread was satisfying as well as symbolic. In a village that could remember times of famine, bread meant celebration. Pita, this native bread, is much more than a culinary or even cultural tradition. It is health. It is passion.

It's why we exercise the most humane and sustainable practices for our premium meats and seafood, why we engage local farmers and producers to bring you fresh, responsibly-sourced produce and why we believe that it's important for you to see where your food comes from and how it got here.

This is not your typical grocer. You can sense that the moment you walk through our door. The variety, the aromas, the freshness, the open market feel, the people who care as much about your food as you do. And we'll go to any lengths necessary...

Long Shadows Vintners now builds upon those successes by bringing some of the world's most celebrated winemakers from the finest wine regions around the globe to Washington in order to create world class wines that showcase the viticultural excellence of Washington State's Columbia Valley.

Each vintner partners individually with Shoup and resident winemaker Gilles Nicault on a distinct winemaking program to produce a single ""best of type"" wine under a unique label.  These include: Pedestal Merlot by Michel Rolland (international consultant and owner Le Bon Pasteur, Pomerol); Sequel Syrah by John Duval (formerly of Penfold's Grange, South Australia); Poet's Leap Riesling by Armin Diel (Schlossgut Diel, Nahe, Germany); Pirouette by Agustin Huneeus (Quintessa, Napa Valley) and Philippe Melka (Vineyard 29, Hundred Acre, Napa Valley); Chester-Kidder by Gilles Nicault (former winemaker at Woodward Canyon, Walla Walla Valley) and Allen Shoup; Feather Cabernet Sauvignon by Randy Dunn (Dunn Vineyards, Napa Valley, formerly of Caymus); and Saggi by Ambrogio & Giovanni Folonari (Cabreo, Nozzole, from Chianti Classico and La Fuga, Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany).

Our system is utilized by consumers to prepare cocktails in their homes, yachts and private events, and by owners and operators of several commercial establishments to address many of the familiar, longstanding challenges of cocktail service.

We are seeing customers use our technology in a variety of ways. Our hotel and sports arena customers use Monsieur as portable, self-service bars that patrons interact with directly. These venues are also using our machines as an upgrade to traditional bottle service that occurs in luxury suites or through a minibar.

The restaurant's name, Otium, has its roots in Latin, a word that is meant

to emphasize a place where time can be spent on leisurely social activities. Adjacent to one of Los Angeles' most important cultural corridors-- Grand Avenue -- and next to its newest, most vibrant addition, the con-temporary art museum, The Broad, Otium strips away the formalities of dining while focusing on the quality of food, warm service, and relaxed casual ambiance, paralleling the true essence of its name.

The restaurant draws inspiration from the 100-year-old olive trees planted in The Broad's adjacent plaza by utilizing rustic cooking with wood fire and sustainable ingredients grown in the garden of the restaurant's mezzanine.

Chef Timothy Hollingsworth's 13 year history in Napa Valley, blended with his present roots as an Angeleno living in downtown Los Angeles, sets the stage for an environment of highly eclectic, vibrant, and seasonal flavors.

To complement the approachable elegance of Hollingsworth's cuisine, the interior design of Otium can be characterized as sophisticated rusticity. A strong but limited palette of natural materials ‚Äì steel, glass, wood,
copper, stone and ceramics - were chosen to create perfectly imperfect spaces that are both raw and refined. The design is an artful mix of old and new, honest and refined, that echoes the menu's offerings.

My father Louie ""Gigi"" Lamonica came from Italy educated as a lawyer, but thankfully realized that America needed Pizzaiolo's more than Lawyer's (he also didn't want to go to school any more). He decided to enter the Pizza Business. He and my uncles owned pizzeria's from Massachusetts to Maryland. In order to ensure a consistent product and have control of sales, he made the Pizza Dough in Brooklyn and shipped it to each pizzeria.

In 1980, together with my Dad, I opened LAMONICA'S NY-PIZZA in Los Angeles. The only way we could ensure the authentic taste of traditional New York pizza was to bring our dough from NY, which we have been doing since 1980.

In 1991 Lamonica's Pizza Dough Company was established and I began producing frozen pizza dough in L.A. We now have two state-of-the-art frozen dough facilities. I have always been committed to making a dough ball that tastes like it was made ""last night"" in the pizza kitchen.

Among our clients you will find COSTCO, LOBLAW SUPERMARKETS (CANADA), NORDSTROM, UNIVERSAL STUDIOS HOLLYWOOD, RESTAURANT DEPOT and 300 AMF BOWLING CENTERS, all of whom appreciate our quality and consistency.

Experienced HACCP trained bakers produce each dough ball and pizza skin using the best ingredients. Our bakers in both N.Y. and L.A. boast over 125 years of combined industrial pizza production experience and will assure you a consistent quality product all year round.

Additionally, the quality, consistency, and safety of our products is ensured by our experience and the added step of x-raying each dough ball and pizza skin.

If you are using, or thinking of using dough balls or pizza skins, please give us a call.

John Lamonica",http://www.lamonicaspizzadough.com,http://www.lamonicaspizzadough.com,https://instagram.com/lamonicaspizza,https://www.lamonicaspizzadough.com/recipes

Rather, it's targeted to replace the mundane meals; running to a meeting, breakfast in the car, stuck in class, etc‚Ä¶ By design, a serving of Keto Chow provides 1/3 of your daily needs of electrolytes, vitamins, protein and more.

It's also quite tasty with a range of great flavors. You combine the powdered mix with your own personal amount of heavy cream to get the calories you want, anywhere from 800 calories a day, up to 2200 calories. Many liken the taste and texture to melted ice cream or a milkshake. The full-flavored mixture of Keto Chow does contain whey protein and artificial sweeteners; if those are a concern for you there's also a ""Base Powder"" option that has the electrolytes and vitamins but not the flavor/protein/sweetener.

521c88b7-3c39-4c79-9068-57b5b86ea822,Louis M. Martini Winery,"The Louis M. Martini Winery was founded in 1933 by an Italian immigrant who began a winemaking legacy that would span generations. Martini was driven by a desire to produce exceptional wines and recognized Napa Valley as the ideal location. He went on to identify Cabernet Sauvignon as the primary red wine varietal suitable for the region, nearly 50 years before Napa Valley was established as an American Viticultural Area famed for this noble grape.
¬†
Martini's preference for hillside-grown fruit led him high into the Mayacamas Mountain range, where he secured a vineyard that would become one of the most coveted sites in California. Monte Rosso Vineyard, named for its celebrated volcanic soil, has been an estate property since 1938. At up to 1200 feet in elevation, it consistently produces red varietals of unmistakable character, with Cabernet Sauvignon vines dating to the 1940s, and is an emblematic source of some of the most acclaimed releases.
¬†
Martini passed the responsibility of crafting complex, varietally expressive Cabernet Sauvignon to his son, Louis P. Martini, whose contributions to the California wine industry were honored in 2008 with his posthumous induction into the Vintners Hall of Fame.
¬†
Today, as the fifth winemaker in the winery's history, Mark Williams continues the legacy of craftsmanship upholding the Martini family's legendary passion and winemaking standards. Williams skillfully crafts Cabernets from esteemed mountain vineyards, including Stagecoach near Atlas Peak, ascending over 1,800 feet above the Napa Valley floor, and Cypress Ranch, located in the rain shadow of Howell Mountain at 1,200 feet.
¬†
The original winery has recently undergone a significant restoration and offers an array of immersive tasting and culinary experiences. Executive Chef Aaron Meneghelli leads his team with a passion that matches the winery's unwavering commitment to craft. Today, guests can enjoy a range of wines and experiences befitting this Napa Valley icon.¬†",http://www.louismartini.com,http://www.louismartini.com,https://instagram.com/louismmartiniwinery,

Flavors so unique you'll never get bored of snacking and will still feel great about eating. Jerky you can KRAVE.

Back to our roots

At KRAVE, we've always believed that snack food doesn't have to be junk food. If something is good for you, it ought to TASTE that way. That's why we are so excited to be right back where we started -in the heart of Sonoma- where the celebrated vineyards, coveted micro-climates and renowned gourmet outposts ensure that around here, quality is a way of life. Our neighboring winemakers, farmers, cheesemakers and artisans influence us with a reverence for incredible quality and unique, bold flavors ‚Äì which are always at the heart of every single product we make.
Life's too short for boring snacks, and we want to make it easier to eat what you KRAVE. A big part of our down-to-earth, never-say-never Sonoma Spirit is embracing the possibility ‚Äî we're able to be more agile and innovative than ever, to once again change how we all snack.

66186cd5-2da5-4120-87be-c02e77e10ec8,"Partender - Bar Inventory, Ordering, and Accounting in 15 Minutes","Partender is a business tool that reduces the time it takes owners and managers to do bar inventory from a frustrating 6-24 hours to 15 minutes or less. We do this by digitizing this crazy, archaic paper-pen-clipboard process into a few taps and swipes on iOS & Android. And because Partender's so fast, our customers doing inventory just once-a-week have increased their bottom lines by 6-8% in under 3 months.

Like the retail industry, the restaurant industry moved into the 21st century with SKU numbers that automated point-of-sale (POS) systems with supply-chain management. Unfortunately, the bar industry is still stuck in the 19th century. To make matters worse, Bevinco (a bar & eatery auditor) estimates that each bar loses 18-31% (or an overall industry average of 23% per bar) of its inventory to ""shrinkage,"" which is a loss of inventory that is not sold. This loss is due to theft, over-pouring, bottle breakage, spillage, and more. That's almost 1-in-4 drinks, and could be a bar's profit margin for the year. In addition, research shows that bar managers order less alcohol from distributors after completing inventory because of shrinkage costs. Because the current process of doing liquor inventory takes so long, it's only done once a week at most. This leaves bars not knowing what their inventory consists of on a daily basis, and leaves them vulnerable to running out of stock before the next reorder. Partender hopes to change this.

By providing an easy-to-use app interface in which a bar manager can slide his or her thumb across a virtual bottle to accurately measure liquor levels, Partender reduces the time it takes managers to inventory from hours to minutes, making bars virtually 100% accountable for their inventory.

Recognizing the complexity of food systems activism, we stand in solidarity with food sovereignty organizations across all levels of the movement, emphasizing regional supply chain justice as our primary focus. We envision universities as anchors for re-regionalizing value chains, sourcing food from diverse, organic, and BIPOC producers reflective of their respective regions.

At the core of our approach lies the conversion of student mobilization into tangible outcomes, guided by the Real Food Standards and measured through the Real Food Calculator. This data-driven advocacy tool holds universities accountable and empowers students to influence policy changes toward a more equitable and sustainable food system.

Our Real Food Standards have been updated and version 3.0 are aligned with our Anchors In Action partners: the Center for Good Food Purchasing, and Healcare Without Harm. We seek to collectively raise the bar for institutions, distributors, and food servicers.

96d04473-d2a6-441b-ae7c-0b40b42554af,Ken Wright Cellars,"40 years of wine making have taught a simple truth: Source is everything. To understand our vineyard sources for Oregon Pinot noir is to understand geology. Two main geological events are responsible for the formation of our region. The collision of the Juan de Fuca Plate and the North American Plate resulted in the shearing off of soft sediments from the ocean floor. The plate is still sub-ducting to this day. Eons of weather and pressure have compacted those soft sediments, creating the sandstone and siltstone parent material which lies below most of the Willamette Valley. The Yamhill-Carlton AVA is comprised of these ancient marine sediments.

The second key geological event is the Columbia River Basalt Flow, the largest flow of lava on planet earth. Originating from an active volcanic chain in eastern Oregon, this lava flow covered the northern Willamette Valley 20 million years ago. Vestiges of this mantle still remain and are represented by areas such as the Dundee AVA and Eola-Amity Hills AVA whose mother rock is a thick layer of fractured basalt, cooled lava, beginning 5-10 feet below the surface.

Pinot noir has the ability to connect us to place unlike anything else we drink or eat. It is like a blank a canvas that is painted with the unique aromas and flavors of its location. Our marine sedimentary sites tend to be more floral and spice focused, while our volcanic sites tend to produce wines that are more fruit driven.",http://www.kenwrightcellars.com,http://www.kenwrightcellars.com,https://instagram.com/kwcellars,

Robert along with his wife Margaret and three sons Robert, Jr., 15; James, 10; and William, 8, arrived in Honolulu on June 19, 1851 after making the 80-day voyage on an American ship named ""Adirondack"". On July 12, 1851, Robert obtained a retail store license permitting him to operate a bakery and sell its products. Robert opened the first Love's Biscuit & Bread Co. on Nu‚Äòuanu Street in 1853.

Robert Love specialized in ""re-baking"" bread from sailing ships that had become inedible, as well as by selling hard biscuits, called hardtack. During 1924 Robert expanded his business and opened a second location in the Iwilei district.  While the Nu‚Äòuanu site continued to produce all types of baked goods, the new Iwilei plant produced only bread and rolls.

Today, Love's Bakery continues Robert Love's tradition by baking fresh products for all of Hawaii. Love's produces 206 varieties of bread, 70 varieties of buns and rolls, and 14 varieties of cakes. Now with a greatly expanded product line, there are more varieties of freshly baked bread, buns and cakes on the shelves and restaurants. Our fresh-baked products are shipped by air to Maui, Kauai, Molokai and the Big Island. We also deliver to grocery stores, military bases, restaurants, schools, and hospitals across the state.

To deliver the freshest possible seafood from local fisherman on the NC Coast.

FOUNDED
2010 by Ryan Speckman & Lin Peterson ‚Äì NC State Fisheries & Wildlife Alumni

BRIEF HISTORY
Ryan lived on the coast for 7 years and became used to his commercial fishing buddies bringing by their daily catch. He soon learned the difference, and acquired a preference for fresh (not frozen), local seafood vs. foreign/frozen for several days/weeks, bland seafood. The idea here is to buy seafood right off the boat (shrimp, crabs, tuna, mahi, grouper, etc.) before it ever has a chance to be frozen and sell it fast in the Triangle. In order to do that we have to deal with the ""small time"" fisherman that fish/crab everyday, but also dock everyday. These aren't the guys that are catching and selling huge volumes to fish markets and wholesalers, where the majority of the product is flash frozen and sits in a freezer for days or weeks before it reaches your plate. Our fisherman are bringing in a high quality catch ‚Äì we hope you will try some! Buy Locals Seafood and experience what seafood is supposed to taste like.

We plan to launch a Community Supported Fishery (CSF) this Fall to link consumers directly to local fisherman. Interested? Please contact us.",http://www.localsseafood.com,http://www.localsseafood.com,https://instagram.com/localsseafood,https://localsseafood.com/blog/recipes/

OUR STORY:
There was once a man called Porky. And one night back in 1970-something, after an evening out over beers and so-so barbecue at a well-established, not-to-be-named local barbecue joint, they declared that they could do better. And they decided Porky-Jo's didn't roll off the tongue quite like Pok-e-Jo's!

So after much experimenting with rubs and smoke and recipes and taste testings, these two friends collaborated with then-recent UT graduate, and now co-owner Doug, and in June of 1979, they boldly opened up the very first Pok-e-Jo's out on North Burnet road. To their utter delight, it quickly became a neighborhood favorite providing the top BBQ in Austin.

Like all good things, word got around, and since that first restaurant, Pok-e-Jo's has grown right along with Austin. Now Porky's son Danny runs the business along with Doug, both sticking with the same idea that started the whole dang business: Do it better.",http://www.pokejos.com,,,

7876302a-c6c3-4d4d-93f0-dbdd8c520fce,Rise Pies,"Rise Pies' story began in 2013, when its sister company, Chestnut Land Company of Youngstown, Ohio, celebrated its 20th year anniversary as a franchisee of Auntie Anne's Soft Pretzels. Chestnut has grown to 70 Auntie Anne's stores in 15 states. For several years, Chestnut had looked to launch a complementary restaurant concept to present to its real estate partners. The concept that kept coming up in Chestnut's discussions was pizza, which 93% of Americans report eating at least once per month.

After considering several franchise concepts in the category, Chestnut CEO Ed Muransky couldn't help but think that many of the pizza offerings in his hometown of Youngstown, Ohio were simply better. He looked to combine the wonderful pizza of Youngstown with the burgeoning fast casual segment of the restaurant industry, and Rise Pies was born. Ed teamed up with his son Eddie and Award-Winning Chef Vernon Cesta, the Owner and Executive Chef at Vernon's Caf√©, an Italian Bistro in Niles, Ohio that has enjoyed over 19 years of success, and V2, a Trattoria and Wine Bar which opened in 2011 and has been a key presence in the revitalization of Downtown Youngstown, Ohio.

Rise Pies features the thin Neapolitan Style pizza of V2, which has won numerous awards, with crusts made fresh daily, 4 different sauces, and over 20 toppings including locally sourced, organic vegetables. And since thin crust pizza, which 61% of Americans prefer, cooks in just 2.5 minutes using a 600 degree WoodStone oven, it is easily transferrable to a fast casual setting. Rise Pies brings top notch pizza, salads, sandwiches, drinks, and desserts in a comfortable modern rustic atmosphere to become the leader in the ever-growing fast casual, limited service pizza segment.",http://www.risepies.com,,,

The duo learned from their father, Ted, who had farmed in the Netherlands, immigrated to the United States, and used his vegetable growing expertise to make his start in the United States.

Miedema Produce began growing bright and crisp radishes, which is now our hallmark product being grown and produced today. Miedema Produce has since become one of the largest growers and shippers of radishes in the world.

For some time, our For You¬Æ brand radishes were grown in Florida so the company could supply customers year around. In the search for a better soil and more reliable growing conditions, we opened farms in Phoenix, Arizona in 1998. Here, in the Valley of the Sun, Miedema found the perfect conditions for growing the finest radishes in the country. Our For You¬Æ radishes are now grown from November to May in Arizona and from June to October in Michigan.

Today, we ship more than one hundred different products to customers across the United States and Canada. Our organization now operates from new offices and state-of-the-art-production facilities incorporating that latest in production efficiencies and food safety. Our refrigerated space has recently doubled and our temperature controlled production facility has increased by 50%.",http://www.miedemaproduce.com,http://www.miedemaproduce.com,https://instagram.com/miedemaproduce,https://miedemaproduce.com/all-recipes/

They found that the temperate climate and rich land of Allegan, Ottawa, Kent and Barry counties produced a bigger and healthier bird.  As word of these great turkeys spread, more families started raising turkeys on their Michigan farms.

Today, these family farms are still in operation. They have been handed down from generation to generation, and they are continuing to produce better turkeys. The proud growers of Michigan Turkey Producers are committed to quality and value from their farms to your table.

Our raw processing plant is designed to meet sanitary and safety standards that far exceed most raw turkey facilities. In fact, the plant more closely resembles a further processor's facility. For example, all of the walls and ceilings are covered in stainless steel so the entire plant can be easily and regularly sanitized.

Michigan Turkey Producers has developed a controlled-atmosphere stunning system for use in our raw plant. Besides being more humane, this proprietary process significantly improves the quality of our meat by reducing blood spots and bruising.

Michigan Turkey Producers offers a wide variety of both raw and cooked turkey products, from ready-to-cook whole breasts and turkey sausage to pre-sliced, oven-roasted and pan-roasted turkey.

From that beginning, the tenets of doing business with Keany have been fairness, human consideration, and personal attention - whether you are a customer, a grower or an employee. For four decades, the Keany family has been serving its customers in ways other produce companies can't, or won't. This is the Keany Way - going the extra mile, delivering on every detail. This has been the company's only plan for business, and four decades of consistent growth has validated its wisdom.

As the region's longest-tenured distributor, Keany was first to offer special services that have since been adopted by others:
-Priority on local, peak-season sourcing, enhanced by deep personal relationships with the region's premier local growers.
-Personal inspections for incoming and outgoing shipments, often conducted by a Keany principal, to ensure the highest quality produce.
-Special cut capability that has expanded to become Keany Kuts - offering upwards of 1700 specialty cuts, the broadest line of custom-prepared produce in the region.
-Keany Express provides a broad range of urgent and same day express services.
-Sustainable practices, including redistribution of excess inventory back to farms for processing.
-Gateway to Gourmet program, bringing new produce products and menu ideas to chefs at their restaurant.
-Distribution up to six days/week for most customers, with flexible customer service hours for ordering.

Today, Keany Produce & Gourmet operates with two world class facilities, in Landover, MD and Richmond, VA. It's original panel truck is now a fleet of more than 170 state-of-the-art, refrigerated produce trucks, distributing to customers in MD, VA, NC, PA, DE, and Washington, DC.

The Bosley's used the 5,000 dollar profit from selling their house to make the down payment, moved in with Catherine's mother and entered the restaurant business with no experience, and little formal education.  Then, the Moonlite was a fourteen year old barbecue joint with 30 seats including stools at the counter.  He was 48 and she 42, they had five children.  Pappy drove a cab for Veterans Cab Company, and worked at Fleischman's Distillery.  Catherine was a foreman at Glenmore Distillery.  It was Pappy's layoff from Fleischman's that caused them to reexamine their opportunities.  Their five children grew up working next door to the Moonlite at the Big Dipper (a local hamburger joint),

Over the last forty-five plus years, Moonlite Bar-B-Q has grown into a very special business. In this time of large chains and merged companies Moonlite has grown as a family business. Hugh and Catherine, along with four children and several grandchildren work together to keep things going and growing at a slow, steady rate that now requires a staff of over 120 dedicated members working various facets of the business. These areas now include a 350 seat restaurant, a U.S.D.A. inspected processing plant, an extensive catering department (capable of serving 15 to 15,000 with unparalleled quality and professionalism), a wholesale division serving the region with Barbecue and related products through distributors in a four state area, as well as a busy carryout department. All this from a thirty seat, roadside restaurant in 1963.

Catherine kept her job at Glenmore until retiring just in case they didn't make it in the restaurant business‚Ä¶They had no experience but worked hard.  Late in her life before she passed away, she finally claimed that Moonlite just might make it, but I should keep my options open just in case - Pat Bosley grandson.",http://www.moonlite.com,,,

Many in Oregon share our philosophy ‚Äî ""Respect the land and treat it well for generations to come."" Lachini Vineyard is hand-farmed using sustainable agriculture and organic practices. Sustainable viticulture not only protects and renews soil fertility but also minimizes adverse impacts on natural biological cycles such as health, safety, wildlife, water quality and the environment. Every farming method we practice, create or implement is meant to increase the vitality and potential of each grapevine.

As of 2008, we have committed to Biodynamic and Organic practices and are currently seeking certification. Through sustainable agriculture and organic farming principles, we are at work within the vineyard daily ‚Äî pruning in the winter months, bud break in early spring, verasion in summer, and harvest in early fall. We limit crop yields to extremely low levels (approximately 2 tons/acre); and through several stages of leaf, canopy and soil management we are able to harvest extremely ripe fruit, which gives us more consistently complex, age worthy and classic Pinot Noirs.

Our tradition, innovation, low-impact winemaking and sustainable farming practices ultimately guide us to craft a continuity of quality that are distinctly Lachini. Our commitment and dedication is inspired by our lifelong journey to pursue a dream and way of life for generations to come.

To top that off there's 3 different bars so you can walk around and feel like you're hitting up 3 bars.

Downstairs there's the Whiskey Bar complete with copper bar and historic Melbourne photos.
Upstairs embrace the black lit Lava Bar with lava lamps and a outdoor deck overlooking downtown.
The outdoor tiki bar serves frozen drinks and takes you on a vacation without having to go anywhere. :)
Not only does Mainstreet have all freshly squeezed ingredients (NO MIXERS!!), but there is also a modern take of pub food. Our delicious menu consists of our flagship, a slow cooked roast beef sandwich, crab stuffed mushrooms, loaded tater tots, our always changing homemade soups, and lots more!",http://www.mymainstreetpub.com,,,

We only sell grass-fed organic dairy because we believe products produced through these regenerative agricultural processes are healthiest for consumers, and are done in a way that is healthiest for the environment.
Maple Hill's organic grass-fed milk supply starts with the health of the soil, the grass, and the happy healthy cows on the family farms with whom we work. As a result, healthy soil is the cornerstone of everything we do.
We work tirelessly within our network of organic 100% grass-fed farmers to develop and implement practices that result in the regeneration of the land through the management of organic grass-fed cows. When managed in harmony with nature, grazing cows are one of the most effective tools on Earth for  igniting the life in the soil ‚Äì which is the foundation of the carbon cycle, soil fertility, economic viability for farmers and the nutrition we receive from our food.
As consumers and retailers alike begin to understand the 100% grass-fed organic value proposition, we have grown our Milkshed from two farms to 130+ in 2022. Maple Hill is now one of the fastest-growing dairy brands in the market. What started as a specialty regional yogurt company in 2009 has become a national dairy brand. Consumers can find Maple Hill in 6,000+ retailers across the U.S., including Whole Foods Market, Sprouts, Kroger, Publix, Walmart, Natural Grocers/Vitamin Cottage, and Safeway, and in thousands of independent grocers and specialty retailers.
Maple Hill is rooted in our desire to provide the best nutrition for our own families and that idea is still the ""heartbeat"" of our company. We believe that 100% grass-fed organic dairy farming done right is the pinnacle of organic; it creates the best nutrition for consumers, and leaves the soil better than we found it.

8a956534-ef53-4b49-845a-396981c0ca6c,Martin Ray Vineyards & Winery,"The name Martin Ray resonates deeply in the history of California Winemaking. Martin Ray was a pioneer, dedicated to crafting single varietal, region specific wine from 1943 through 1972 in Saratoga, in the heart of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Mentored by Paul Masson, he took a burgundian approach to his winemaking, and developed what is now one of the most historical properties in California, known as Mount Eden.

Nearly twenty years later, Courtney Benham stumbled upon 1500 cases of Martin Ray wine in a San Jose warehouse. Recognizing his good fortune, and his intent and drive to produce terroir driven wines, Ray's historical significance and philosophy resonated with him. Courtney purchased the brand, and since 1990 has been committed to the production of artisanal wines worthy of the Martin Ray name.

In 2003, Martin Ray Vineyards & Winery made its home in the Russian River Valley, on the edge of Green Valley at one of the oldest continually working wineries in California. Today, Courtney and his winemaking team devote themselves to Ray's ideology of making ""wines of place"". By sourcing from hillside vineyards, they are relentless at telling the story of each exceptional appellation and vineyard. The depth of the portfolio offers those seeking a unique experience the chance to explore some of the most revered appellations in California. From our 12 acre Estate, to the mountain regions of Santa Cruz and Napa, to the northern reaches of Dry Creek Valley and Sonoma Coast, there is an abundance of phenomenal growing regions, great farming, and meticulous detail to vintages.",http://www.martinraywinery.com,http://www.martinraywinery.com,https://instagram.com/martinraywinery,https://www.martinraywinery.com/blog/2020/12/15/mrs-guide-to-mulled-wine/

7ff518c6-67e7-47ec-9b6d-d90a74786f8f,MIKUNA¬Æ,"Mikuna introduced Chocho to the US with a mission to change the future of food. An ancient legume packed with protein and nutrients, Chocho has superior health and environmental benefits. Mikuna supports local Andean farmers, and is proud to create foods that are rooted in regeneration.
Chocho (pronounced ‚Äòcho-cho') is an ancient lupin that's been cultivated by indigenous farmers for thousands of years. It grows in the Andes mountains at an elevation of 11,000-14,000 feet. It's drought-tolerant and survives on rainwater alone.

Chocho is extremely nutrient-dense and packed with protein, omegas, fiber, iron, and calcium.

The coolest part? Chocho creates a cycle of regeneration. It enriches the soil, nourishes the body, supports local Andean communities, and helps clean our air. Over time, chocho has the potential to help reverse climate change, and through this tiny bean we strive for our global impact to be a positive one.

Let's do food better. Together.",http://www.mikunafoods.com,http://www.mikunafoods.com,https://instagram.com/mikunafoods,https://mikunafoods.com/blogs/regenerative/tagged/recipes

Company History:
In the early 1900's the Lehi Roller Mill and Elevator Company served local farmers around Lehi, Utah. In 1905, its shareholders invested $20,000 in what would become the Lehi Roller Mills. The new mill, which boasted the most modern equipment of the time, turned out its first flour in April 1906.

Four years later, George G. Robinson purchased the Lehi Roller Mills and a family tradition of consistent, dependable milling was born. Within three years, George G. began an extensive modernization project as the demands for flour continued to increase. By 1925, Lehi Roller Mills was delivering flour by the carload to bakeries and dealers in Salt Lake City and California. When George G. Robinson died in 1936, his son, Sherman D. Robinson took charge of the mill until 1980. Today, his son (George G.'s grandson) R. Sherman Robinson still runs the mill.  Under his direction, production capabilities have expanded, a new warehouse has been built, a state-of-the-art mix plant has been installed, and new product lines have been created.

Today, Lehi Roller Mills is still evolving. Equipment upgrades are consistent and innovative processes are introduced on an on-going basis. However, the philosophy is still the same: ""Only the best wheat makes the best flour."" The care we put into every bag we produce has not changed since 1906.",http://www.lehimills.com,http://www.lehimills.com,https://instagram.com/lehimills,https://lehimills.com/blogs/muffins

Mr. Espresso features a lineup of single origin coffees, espresso blends, and house blends with organic and fair trade options, as well as several decaffeinated blends.
In addition to its premium coffees, Mr. Espresso also hosts a large variety of imported espresso equipment for sale from top Italian manufacturers such as Mazzer and Macap, and as the exclusive distributor of Faema espresso machines in Northern California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada and Hawaii. All machines are UL and NSF standard approved.

Offering wholesale beans, high-quality espresso equipment, and service and training support, Mr. Espresso made its mark as one of the first full-service coffee roasting retailers in the market and has since become a Bay Area institution, serving a sizable share of coffeehouses and restaurants in San Francisco Bay area and beyond.

Mr. Espresso continues to be family-owned and operated with two generations of Di Ruoccos working together in the Oakland showroom and roasting facility to ensure that what Carlo Di Ruocco began over 30 years ago continues striking that wonderful balance between time-honored traditional methods and the emerging trends of the marketplace.",http://www.mrespresso.com,http://www.mrespresso.com,https://instagram.com/mrespressooak,https://mrespresso.com/recipe-collection/

Our building is supposed to have been built in 1947, however we now have evidence that the building is slightly older. The original owners say that it was more likely built around 1925, there is also an older story of this property, early travelers had tales of a plentiful well where they fetched the much needed water for their horses.

MAINSTREET PUB TODAY

Mainstreet Pub prides itself on quality. All drinks are made with fresh fruit being juiced right in front of you. There's no sour mixes here and you'll be spoiled from the first sip!

To top that off there's 3 different bars so you can walk around and feel like you're hitting up 3 bars.

Downstairs there's the Whiskey Bar complete with copper bar and historic Melbourne photos.
Upstairs embrace the black lit Lava Bar with lava lamps and a outdoor deck overlooking downtown.
The outdoor tiki bar serves frozen drinks and takes you on a vacation without having to go anywhere. :)
Not only does Mainstreet have all freshly squeezed ingredients (NO MIXERS!!), but there is also a modern take of pub food. Our delicious menu consists of our flagship, a slow cooked roast beef sandwich, crab stuffed mushrooms, loaded tater tots, our always changing homemade soups, and lots more!",http://www.mainstreetpubmelbourne.com,,,

We honor distilling heritage by combining premium ingredients, innovative distillation processes, and thoughtful barrel aging and finishing to build our own house of craft spirits.

If whiskey isn't your thing, you're in luck‚Äîwe also produce vodkas, gins, rums, and brandies. No matter what you like to drink, we have a seat for you, a cocktail you'll love, and a bottle to take home.

Founded in 2013, Manatawny Still Works sits near the banks of the Manatawny Creek, an 18.2-mile-long tributary of the mighty Schuylkill River. The creek cuts through the Montgomery County countryside and joins the Schuylkill at our home in Pottstown, Pennsylvania. Just northwest of Philadelphia, the county is brimming with historical significance and natural beauty. The creek was first named by the indigenous Lenape Man'en'tau'wata'wik, ""the place we meet to drink,"" and it means the same to us today.

We hustle to find opportunities to serve you, whether it's in PA Fine Wine and Good Spirits stores across the state, in our own tasting rooms, in local bars and restaurants, at farmer's markets and events in the region, or in our own online shop. And while we take our commitment to delivering quality spirits seriously, we refuse to lose sight that we are in this venture to have some fun.

We're proud to help you and yours get together to discover and enjoy the whiskies you love, as well as the joy of the spirit that follows: to help you Find Your Manatawny.",http://www.manatawnystillworks.com,http://www.manatawnystillworks.com,https://instagram.com/manatawnystillworks,

Our vineyards are planted with classic European, Italian and American varietals. All of our grapes are hand harvested and gently processed in our facility, we call this the art of wine. Our techniques are meticulous; the secret lies in the management of the vineyard. Our Wine Maker, Ariel, shines when turning wonderful fruit into wine. After harvest the wine is taken to our climate controlled Barrel Room where it is given the perfect environment for integration of flavor and aroma between wood and fruit.

The winemaker or distiller can only highlight flavors and aromas that already exist, not invent flavor. That is what the art of oaking is all about. For centuries, winemakers and distillers have used oak to bring out the best in wine and spirits. The biggest problem aside from the cost of oak barrels is the amount of time it takes for the oaking process to work.

""The Oak Bottle is not only for the wine or spirit connoisseur and it is easy, fast, and inexpensive enough for anyone to use. We are excited to offer the world a way to convert the wines and spirits we all love from ordinary to extraordinary,"" says Joel Paglione, founder of Oak Bottle.

The traditional use of 59 gallon oak barrels for wine making was impractical and expensive. In the past only the best winemakers had access to cooperages that made the best oak barrels. Everyone should have the ability to adjust and refine their favorite wine or spirits flavor using something they can place in the palm of their hand. And what better than an oaking vessel that can also double as a beautiful table piece bottle? With Oak Bottle, it's possible for anyone to experience the fun of making your own wine or spirit without having to actually invest all of the time and money.",http://www.oakbottle.com,,,

Maxx Performance was founded in 2004 with a simple goal: to extend the useful life of food and feed additive ingredients using microencapsulation technologies and bring about true innovation on behalf of our customers and their consumers.

Whether we use our own ingredients or source them from our collaborators, here are just a few of the ways we're making an impact:

We innovated the first preservative-free, flavor-masking solution for green tea extract and helped make this in-demand antioxidant a palatable, and profitable supplement

We also have a robust platform in place for stabilizing oxygen-sensitive ingredients like probiotics and enzymes to increase thermal stability and to improve bioavailability and nutrient delivery

In the midst of the growing demand for antibiotic-free meat protein, we're pioneering the use of microencapsulates to reduce the need for medicated feed additives in animal production

Our leavening system helps bakery manufacturers improve texture, eliminate translucency issues, slow pH transitions and dramatically improve shelf life

For every ton of palm oil and palm kernel oil we use, we pay a voluntary premium to a producer who is operating within the RSPO's strict guidelines for social and environmental responsibility

Of course, helping customers meet new consumer demands is only half the story. We apply resources to solving other manufacturing challenges too like improving efficiency and speeding time to market.

You'd be amazed at what microencapsulated ingredients can do.",http://www.maxxperformance.com,,,

 	The terminal elevator has a storage capacity for 5.3 million bushels of wheat. The terminal elevator blends, cleans, and transfers wheat to the ten milling units and provides wheat storage to farmers, country elevators and government agencies.
80% of the Mill's flour and semolina is shipped on bulk rail cars and trucks, 20% of finished products are packaged in bags for shipment via boxcars and trucks. Product is also packed in totes/super sacks for shipment.
The North Dakota Mill receives no funds or financial assistance from the State of North Dakota to subsidize the milling operations. Selling value- added milled wheat products to bakery and pasta customers, as well as retail and food service suppliers, generates all operating funds. Over 90% of sales revenues are derived from customers outside the State to create value-added income for the State of North Dakota. The North Dakota Mill supports the local economy with a payroll of $16 million annually.
The North Dakota Mill and Elevator Association has contributed more than 50% of its profits to the North Dakota State General Fund for more than 50 years and continues to be an asset to the State of North Dakota.

We chose it because, in addition to the traditional recipes learned by apprenticing in Gelaterie in Italy, we are continuously inspired to create new exotic recipes by pairing the best fresh ingredients from all over the world.

Forget flying across the Atlantic for the creamy, rich flavor of authentic Italian gelato; instead, Paciugo brings Italy to you. For the past ten years, the U.S gelateria has emerged as a leader in the $26 billion U.S. frozen dessert sector, renowned for its authentically hand-made gelato, made fresh daily from natural ingredients.

Paciugo was founded by Ugo Ginatta and his wife Cristiana in April 2000, in Dallas, TX. They have imported Italian ingredients, machinery and techniques from their native Italy to duplicate the fourth-generation recipes from their home cities of Turin and Milan, respectively. Ugo's son, Vincent, joined the company at the end of 2000 upon graduating in mechanical engineering.

Since 2000, Paciugo cafes have been delighting guests with a tremendous variety of high-quality and unique menu items. Every morning, each Paciugo cafe freshly prepares its gelato, serving 30 to 38 flavors daily.

Currently, there are 18 Paciugo retail locations in the greater Dallas area, and many more cafes throughout the USA, for a total of 45 locations, including the US Virgin Islands.",http://www.paciugo.com,,,

Classes feature instructors ranging from the Market's own vendors and local chefs to nationally known cookbook authors. The Palm Garden and Kitchen are also available for private event rentals, including corporate team-building events, company functions, weddings, and private parties.

A visit to the Market isn't complete without exploring its architecturally acclaimed structure. From its iconic neon signs to its curated collection of antiques reflecting Milwaukee's rich history, including a vintage VW bus repurposed as the counter for the On The Bus restaurant, the photo opportunities are endless. Just steps away, guests can stroll along the scenic Milwaukee Riverwalk and explore the charming Historic Third Ward neighborhood.

If you're looking to experience the best of Milwaukee, or host a private event, there is no better place than the Milwaukee Public Market.",http://www.milwaukeepublicmarket.org,,,

The Pomptonian was established in 1959. Founded as a restaurant, The Pomptonian, in Cedar Grove, New Jersey was located across the street from the popular Meadowbrook Dinner Theater. In 1961, the town of Cedar Grove completed construction of its High School and needed someone to run the cafeteria. The Board members approached The Pomptonian restaurant, asking for some temporary help, and we are still thriving in that district today.

The restaurant flair The Pomptonian brought to school food service spurred commendations and recommendations. In 1970, the company was managing four school cafeterias and had another two coming aboard early the next year. The restaurant was sold and Pomptonian's efforts were devoted entirely to quality school service.

The reputation of quality and innovative service earned by each Pomptonianite encouraged more and more districts to join the family of Pomptonian cafeterias.

Throughout the years, the company has enjoyed diversified experiences in food service, including restaurants, catering, corporate dining, and school service. For many years our single focus has been on school service. Pomptonian serves over 100 school districts throughout the state of New Jersey and has over 2,000 employees.

The Lenger family from Harlingen have been active in the shellfish industry for over 93 years when they fished for herring and anchovy. Later they started to farm mussels and they began to fish on cockles on the Waddensea.

Today Lenger Seafoods stands for fishing, cultivation, processing and marketing of traditional and sustainable fished shellfish - and crustaceans like cockles, mussels, razor clams, scallops, whelks, oysters, langoustines and much more. Export of frozen, chilled, fresh and preserved products goes worldwide into retail, foodservice - and industrial markets.

For its headquarters the Group chose Yerseke, the shellfish centre of northern Europe with fast distribution to the main markets in Europe. In Harlingen Lenger has developed a strong shellfish production with close distance to the source. These two locations ensure that Lenger is active in what for centuries have been the two most important shellfish grounds in the Netherlands, the Easterscheldt and the Waddensea.

Lenger Seafoods recognises the need for clarity, both internal as well as external. The transparent company structure guarantees clarity in communication with clients at all levels. You are always connected by a direct line to their personnel, many of whom have a fisheries background and all have extensive knowledge of the products that we bring on the market.

Some facts about the Lenger Seafoods Group:

- Founded in Harlingen 1925
- Family Lenger, 93 years in shellfish business
- 300 employees

Born out of the friendship between Jason Momoa and Blaine Halvorson and their mutual obsession with the process, craft, and the journey to construct something truly unique. Meili is the outcome of their journey to craft the best vodka on the planet - from the spirit to the bottle.

It is crafted with unbreakable attention to quality, harnessing the power of the four elemental forces of fire, water, earth, and air ‚Äî each forming the backbone of this vodka and symbolizing a different aspect of its unique character. The fire is the heart of the spirit, igniting the stills and imbuing the glass bottles with its fiery essence that's reflected in their hand-textured appearance. The glass bottles, made from 100% post-consumer recycled materials, also serve as a testament to the brand's commitment to sustainability. The water, sourced from the purest 300 million-year-old aquifer, is the soul of the spirit, providing it with a crisp and supremely refreshing character. The body of Meili is drawn from the earth, where locally sourced and sustainably grown native and seasonal grains bring a bright and effortless flavor. Finally, the mountain air of Montana breathes life into the vodka, smoothing out the texture as it relaxes 11,000 feet above sea level.",http://www.meilivodka.com,http://www.meilivodka.com,https://instagram.com/meilivodka,https://www.meilivodka.com/
636f188e-15c1-40e4-9aaf-5162c18f72b8,Mama's on the Half Shell,"In 2003, we opened Mama's on the Half Shell. Our opening day was the realization of five years of dreaming, discussing and collecting. As native ""Baltimoreans,"" we felt Baltimore lacked a real seafood restaurant. Because of our love for the restaurant business, our favorite pastime is to dine out, but we struggled to find the real taste of Baltimore seafood. We missed the classics, the ones that we could count on as kids, such as Connolly's & Hausner's, the one we would visit with friends from out of town who say ""take us to a real Baltimore seafood house."" We missed that and wanted to bring it back. That's why we created Mama's on the Half Shell.

Our menu is the most important part of our restaurant, but we also want our guests to come in and feel comfortable for any occasion: bringing in a client, Sunday football, a birthday, anniversary or just some time out. It's a great place to visit after a day on the water and it's also remembered by some as the place where they got engaged. Our restaurant is a place that you could ""bring it or bring it down."" There is really no average age at Mama's on the Half Shell which leads us to believe this truly is a Baltimore classic for food and celebration.

For a good start to a classic Baltimore meal at Mama's, order a fried crab cake with mustard and our famous Orange Crush. Have a seat at the raw bar and just drift back into your best Baltimore memory, hon!

It is our hope that when you are with us you feel you are welcomed into our home with
open arms.""",http://www.mamasonthehalfshell.com,,,

It was really just a place for Ted and his friends to gather, but Matula's incredible cooking skills could not be ignored. One night she decided to make ribs, and people went nuts for them. Soon a local critic dubbed Ted the ""Ribs King,"" and the legend was secured. As the town of Montgomery blossomed, word of these incredible ribs spread fast‚Äîso much so that the Inn became a mecca for any celebrity passing though town, a tradition that lives on to this day.
Two locations: The Original Montgomery Inn and The Boathouse.  Montgomery Inn food is so beloved that it‚Äòs available online anywhere in the country for those who can't wait to get their fix. The Gregory children are carrying on their parents' legacy, making sure Montgomery Inn remains one of the finest family restaurants in the country, and keeping the colorful memory of the Ribs King alive and well.The Best Ribs on the Planet. And Beyond.
Ted and Matula Gregory truly earned the titles of Ribs King and Ribs Queen. When we say our ribs are famous, we mean it. Enjoyed by actors, athletes, and every U.S. President since Gerald Ford, they're hand-spiced and slow-roasted daily, then finished off on our custom broiler. But Matula's secret recipe sauce is the real star, made with only the finest California tomatoes and a super-secret blend of all-natural spices. And don't worry about wearing a bib.

For many years, tourists flocked to the local fishermen's houses to feast on local pacific lobsters. These lobsters, split open and flash-fried, were presented on big platters and served with piping hot flour tortillas, delicious ranchero beans and  Mexican rice. Guests would pick the meat from the shells and wrap it in the tortillas along with the beans, rice and a dousing of hot sauce! And of course, icy cold Mexican beers and pitchers of margaritas would be the beverage of choice!

In 1983, Rick DiRienzo, the founder of Rockin' Baja Lobster created his now famous Baja Buckets¬Æ. Not satisfied with just lobster prepared Baja style, he experimented doing every type of shellfish the same way. Our buckets now come with choices ranging from slipper lobster tail, shrimp, and snow crab, all prepared Baja style. The Original Baja Bucket¬Æ comes overflowing to your table with Baja style slipper lobster tails and shrimp along with grilled carne asada and chicken. A house favorite!

Since our beginnings in 1950 as a small poultry farm in Connecticut's Farmington Valley, we've known that the key to our pets living a long and healthy life starts in their bowl. We believe in a protein focused diet of real, natural, unprocessed foods - as nature intended. Our pet food is made in small batches with care from local sources we've trusted for decades. As pioneers in raw pet food, our unwavering commitment to quality and our customers stands the test of time.

4th Generation / Family Owned & Operated / Majority Women Owned

We make it a priority to educate those invested in the well-being of animals about the benefits of a raw, natural pet food diet. Our knowledgeable staff is available to conduct seminars, help answer questions, and provide continued support and guidance anytime.

Oma's Pride is connected to Miller Farms, a fourth generation, community driven family business that believes Everyone Is Family. Founded in 1950, Miller Farms has sold Thanksgiving turkeys for 70 years. This year, we launched the Thankful Turkey‚Äîfor every turkey purchased, one is given to a family in need through Foodshare, our local food bank partner.
